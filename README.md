# Rose-Cafeteria
Creating an Application and Website for the Rose Cafeteria
This project was a website and an android application for the Rosebank Cafeteria and it was used to help them have an online system as close to MR D for the cafeteria where students were able to order from classes and would schedule picking up time so they would get their meal still fresh and warm. This solved problems such as kids having to fill up queues in cafeteria and them being late for lectures.
This was a collection only service and was specific for kids who attend the campus.
